# Air Loom

**Air Loom** is a reverse literate programming tool: it takes code and documentation and weaves them together. It is both language-agnostic and markup language-agnostic.

## Example

Given a `hello.c` file:

```c++
// loom:start(file)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    // loom:start(printf)
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    // loom:end(printf)
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
// loom:end(file)
```

And `hello.md`:

~~~markdown
# Hello, World in C

Traditionally, the way to kick the tires on a programming language is to
write a program that simply prints "Hello, world!" and exits. In C, the
function for printing text is called `printf`, and we use it like this:

```c
loom:include(printf)
```

The whole program looks like this:

```c
loom:include(file)
```
~~~

Then the following:

```bash
$ airloom lift hello.c -o frags.json
$ airloom weave hello.md -f frags.json -o docs.md
```

Will produce a file `docs.md` with the following contents:

~~~markdown
# Hello, World in C

Traditionally, the way to kick the tires on a programming language is to
write a program that simply prints "Hello, world!" and exits. In C, the

```

The whole program looks like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
~~~
    
## Conceptual Overview

Traditionally, there are two approaches to literate programming:

1. You write code inside your documentation, and a program extracts and concatenates the listings into source code. This worked in the 70's, but nowadays, you lose all the benefits of IDEs.
2. A newer approach is to write the documentation within the code as block comments, then a program strips the comment markers and turns everything that's not a comment into a code block. The problem with this approach is many languages require declarations to appear in a specific order, which is rarely the ideal reading order.

With Air Loom, you write your code in source files, retaining all the benefits of using IDEs, and use comment directives to define named chunks of code called _fragments_. Then, in your documentation, you use directives to include fragments. Air Loom then lifts the fragments out of the code and weaves them into the documentation. Code and documentation are entirely separated.

## Usage

The `lift` command extracts fragments from a set of files into a fragments file:

```bash
airloom lift lib.c hello.c test.c -o fragments.json
```

The `weave` command takes a number of documentation files and a fragments file, it weaves the fragments into the documentation and concatenates them together:

```bash
airloom weave intro.md examples.md api.md -f fragments.json -o docs.md
```

If you don't want to concatenate the output, just process them one file at a time:

```bash
airloom weave intro.md    -f fragments.json -o build/intro.md
airloom weave examples.md -f fragments.json -o build/examples.md
airloom weave api.md      -f fragments.json -o build/api.md
```

## Example Makefile Usage

The following is an example of using Air Loom with `make`:

```make
SRC   := src/*.c
FRAGS := fragments.json
DOCS  := intro.md concepts.md frontend.md core.md backend.md api.md
MAN   := manual.md

$(FRAGS): $(SRC)
    airloom lift $(SRC) -o $(FRAGS)

$(MAN): $(FRAGS) $(DOCS)
    airloom weave $(DOCS) -f $(FRAGS) -o $(MAN)

clean:
    rm $(FRAGS)
```

## Downloading

## Building

You need [stack][stack] installed. Then:

[stack]: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/eudoxia0/airloom.git
$ cd airloom
$ stack build
```

## Future Work

- Warnings
    - Warn when a file has no fragments.
    - Warn when there are unused fragments.
    - Complete mode: every non-blank line must be part of a fragment.
- Escaping: allow prefixing directives with `\` to skip processing.
- Transclusion escaping:
    - When transcluding code into e.g. XML, it would be useful to have an option to escape incompatible characters.
