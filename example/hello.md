# Hello, World in C

Traditionally, the way to kick the tires on a programming language is to
write a program that simply prints "Hello, world!" and exits. In C, the
function for printing text is called `printf`, and we use it like this:

```c
loom:include(printf)
```

The whole program looks like this:

```c
loom:include(file)
```
